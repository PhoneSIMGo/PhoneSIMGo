## Three: How can 5G + eSIM double internet speed for cross-country travel? 

### 1. High-speed Connection: Say goodbye to roaming speed limitations

Traditional international roaming usually restricts the user's internet speed and even leads to unstable internet connection. With the **5G eSIM package**, users can directly access the local 5G network and enjoy native speeds.

- **Case in point**: A businessman traveling to Germany on a business trip connected to the local 5G network in Germany via eSIM, and the download speed was up to 350Mbps, which is several times faster than the traditional roaming speed.

### **2. Seamless multi-country switching: maintaining network stability**

Frequent network switching during cross-country travel can lead to disconnection or weak signal. eSIM ensures that users are always connected to the 5G network with the strongest signal through the automatic switching function.

- **Case in point**: A backpacker traveling in Europe realized seamless switching between Germany, France and Italy through the eSIM package, always maintaining a high-speed network connection.

### **3. Real-time response: smooth experience with low latency**

The low latency feature of 5G combined with the fast activation feature of eSIM allows users to enjoy a smoother network experience while traveling.

- **Case in point**: A remote worker used an eSIM to connect to a 5G network for a videoconference in Japan, with latency as low as 10ms and no lag at all.

### **4. Multi-Device Sharing: Satisfy the Demands of Complex Scenarios**

With eSIM's hotspot function, users can share the 5G network to other devices, such as tablets or laptops, suitable for travelers who need multi-device connectivity.

- **Case in point**: A family of four is traveling in Thailand, and through the hotspot function of the parents' phone, the children's tablets can also enjoy the high-speed connection of 5G network.
